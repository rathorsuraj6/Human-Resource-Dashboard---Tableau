Hi everyone,
I recently completed one of my latest Tableau project, and I'm thrilled with the results. I created an interactive HR dashboard that provides insights into employee overview, demographics, and more.

What I Learned Throughout This Process:
- Creating various charts and visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, heat maps, scatter plots, and barbell charts
- Designing an interactive and user-friendly HR dashboard with filters and calculated fields
- Identifying trends and patterns using effective visualizations

Key Charts Included:
- Comparing salary distribution across different genders
- Analyzing educational qualifications relative to age
- Tracking hiring and termination trends over time
- Evaluating performance ratings across age groups and educational qualifications

This was a great experience and even though it took me around 2 days, I was able to learn a lot of new tools and features in Tableau. Special thanks to Baraa Khatib Salkini, for incredible tutorials on Tableau. His contents made the learning process engaging and accessible. 

Check out my HR dashboard and let me know your thoughts! Looking forward to more data adventures with Tableau.
